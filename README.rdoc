= QueryBuilder

* http://zenadmin.org/524

== DESCRIPTION:

QueryBuilder is an interpreter for the "pseudo sql" language. This language
can be used for two purposes:

 1. protect your database from illegal SQL by securing queries
 2. ease writing complex relational queries by abstracting table internals

== SYNOPSIS:
  
  # Create your own query class (DummyQuery) to parse your specific models (see test/mock).
  
  # Compile a query:
  query = DummyQuery.new("images where name like '%flower%' from favorites")
  
  # Get compilation result:
  query.to_s
  => "['SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE links.source_id = ?', @node.id]"
    
  # Evaluate bind variables (produces executable SQL):
  query.sql(binding)
  => "SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE links.source_id = 1234"
      
  # Compile to get count instead of records:
  query.to_s(:count)
  => "['SELECT COUNT(*) ... WHERE links.source_id = ?', @node.id]"
  
  query.sql(binding, :count)
  => "SELECT COUNT(*) ... WHERE links.source_id = 1234"
